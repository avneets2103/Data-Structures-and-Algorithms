//Every work in the BST is an order of O(h), thus for a efficient work system its very important for the tree to be more balanced
// Balanced tree: 
//|right height - left height| <= 1 for every node and not only the root
//for a balanced tree: h = logn

//AVL:
//Works from rotation of the tree to maintain a balance btwn the sides
//Self balancing Binary search tree
//https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBIhFbvavLk :
//great video for understanding rotation
